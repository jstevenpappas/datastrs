'''
    Palindrom - a word spelled the same backwards as forwards.
        Facts:  1) palindromes can be of odd and even len
                2) 
                    a) if string is odd len:
                        -> it must have 1 char that had odd freq and the rest of the chars of even freq
                    b) if string is even:
                        -> all chars must have even freq
