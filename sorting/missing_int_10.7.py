"""Missing Int.

Given an input file with 4 billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm
to generate an integer that is not contained in the file.
Assume you have 1GB of memory available for this task.

Follow up:
What is you have only 10MB of memory?  Assume that all the values are distinct and
we now have no more than 1 billion non-negative integers.

"""



'''
Discussion:

We have 1 Gigabyte of memory
1 byte = 8 bits
1 gig = 2^9th (or 1 billion)
so we have 8 billion bytes


NOTE: skipped for time being
